 #Making text bold
  
 # This is the highest level of the text.
## This is the second highest level of the text.
### Each hash mark creates a new level of text for headers.
#### These are useful for subsections for large chunks of information.
##### There are six different headers you can use for text.
###### This is sixth section!

# Applying styles on text

**This text is bold.**

*This text is in italics.* _This text is also in italics._

~~This text has a strike-through applied.~~

~~**What if something is really important gets crossed out?**~~

_**It's pretty easy to ~~apply~~ multiple styles.**_


# Quoting Text

> I body him.

>> There's gonna come a point where you'll forget about what happened and you're gonna wanna come back at me.

>>> Don't get hit

>>>> SERIOUSLY, don't get hit.

>>>>> These keep nesting at 20. I stopped checking after that point.
